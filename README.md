# Task-3-SQL-Query

Summary of the SQL analysis performed on the e-commerce data:

The analysis begins with data exploration, including selecting all data and focusing on specific columns like customer information and sales amounts. Basic analysis involves calculating total sales by category, average profit by state, and total quantity sold by sub-category to understand sales performance. Further, it identifies customers in Gujarat with high-value orders and analyzes sales and profit by city, customer order frequency, and monthly sales trends to find key customers and sales patterns. The analysis also calculates average quantity by category and sub-category, total profit by state and category, and identifies customers with multiple orders.

Advanced techniques using joins identify orders containing both furniture and electronics and customers ordering from multiple categories, revealing purchasing patterns. Subqueries find customers with above-average order amounts and states with above-average total sales, highlighting top performers. Views are created for category sales and state-wise sales performance to simplify recurring queries. Finally, indexes are created and analyzed to optimize query performance, demonstrating how to speed up data retrieval. Overall, the SQL code provides insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance, with optimization techniques for efficiency.
